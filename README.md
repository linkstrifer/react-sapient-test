This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Dev environment

Just run `npm i`

Then run `npm start`, this should mount a local environment in http://localhost:3000

There is a linter error, something about `jsx-a11y/href-no-hash`, no idea what is that so i can't fix it


## Git branching

There are two versions of the test, one with redux and one without it, you can find those on `react-redux` and `react-only` branches
